 Are you already or interested in becoming an Optimistic Wanderer? If so, this is a great spot to start. 
 Below are a list of trails and parks around or just outside of Central Ohio. Each trail will 
 list the difficulty level, distance, trail map, path type, and address. Once you have found 
 a park or trail that peaks your interest, select the link to see our blogger's reviews and 
 comments. Our bloggers leave helpful hints for each park or trail. The best part of this 
 site is once you have visited a trail or park in the area, you can become a blogger too! 
 Join the conversation. Get out and get moving! Nature is calling!
