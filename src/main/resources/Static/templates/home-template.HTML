    Welcome to the Optimistic Wanderer's blog site. This site is for the Optimistic 
    Wanderer who loves trails and nature. We are all wanderers at heart and welcome 
    the adventurers and risk takers along with the families and teens. This blog was 
    created to share in our experience while using hiking trails and park in Central 
    Ohio. We encourage all readers to blog about their experiences. If you choose to 
    be an Optimistic Wander Blogger, I ask that you fill out all required fields. This site 
    is family friendly, so please keep your reviews and blogs respectful.
